#print function prints the line
print("Hello World")
print(5)
print(7+5)
print("7+5") #prints 7+5 if in double quotes it is a string
print('7+5') #it also prints 7+5 
#There is no difference between single quotes and double quotes for defining string literals in Python

print("He said, 'Hello!'")
print('She replied, "Hi there!"')
# Here strings can be printed as above where two quotation marks are used within each other
